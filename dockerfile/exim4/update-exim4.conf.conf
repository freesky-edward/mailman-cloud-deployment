# Please note that this is _not_ a dpkg-conffile and that automatic changes

# update-exim4.conf uses this file to determine variable values to generate
# exim configuration macros for the configuration file.

# Most settings found in here do have corresponding questions in the
# Debconf configuration, but not all of them.

# This is a Debian specific file

# Remark on configuration `dc_eximconfig_configtype`:
# Used to configure type for the mail server.
#    1. internet site; mail is sent and received directly using SMTP
#    2. mail sent by smarthost; received via SMTP or fetchmail
#    3. mail sent by smarthost; no local mail
#    4. local delivery only; not on a network
#    5. no configuration at this time

# Remark on configuration `dc_other_hostnames`:
# The 'mail name' is the domain name used to 'qualify' mail addresses without a domain name.
# This name will also be used by other programs. It should be the single, fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
# Thus, if a mail address on the local host is foo@example.org, the correct value for this option would be example.org.
# This name won't appear on From: lines of outgoing messages if rewriting is enabled.
dc_other_hostnames='tommylike.me;'

# Remark on configuration `dc_local_interfaces`:
# Please enter a semicolon-separated list of IP addresses. The Exim SMTP listener daemon will listen on all IP addresses listed here.
# An empty value will cause Exim to listen for connections on all available network interfaces.
dc_local_interfaces=''

# Remark on configuration `dc_readhost`:
# Please enter a semicolon-separated list of recipient domains for which this machine should consider itself the final destination. These domains are commonly called 'local domains'. The local hostname (local.tommylike.me) and 'localhost' are always added to the list given here.
# By default all local domains will be treated identically. If both a.example and b.example are local domains, acc@a.example and acc@b.example will be delivered to the same final destination. If different domain names should be treated differently, it is necessary
# to edit the config files afterwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     â”‚ Other destinations for which mail is accepted:

# Remark on configuration `dc_relay_domains`:
#  Please enter a semicolon-separated list of recipient domains for which this system will relay mail, for example as a fallback MX or mail gateway.
#  This means that this system will accept mail for these domains from anywhere on the Internet and deliver them according to local delivery rules.

# Remark on configuration `dc_relay_nets`:

# You should use the standard address/prefix format (e.g. 194.222.242.0/24 or 5f03:1200:836f::/48).
# If this system should not be a smarthost for any other host, leave this list blank.
